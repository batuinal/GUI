Project Overview:

The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for a software program, which improves the life of patients with Autism Spectrum  Disorder. We were asked to propose a project, specifically for Prof.Ahlquist’s daughter Ara, which would promote collaboration between people who have ASD and family/friends. This memo contains the potential idea we have come up with for this project; a game similar to “Tap Tap Revenge”, adapted to the real-world environment.
 
We believe that our proposed project would meet the needs of Ara, improving her kinesthetic senses and body control. The project has the potential to be extended to other patients diagnosed with ASD by adding extra features with respect to their special needs.

Project Definition:
 
ASD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, is seen in one out of sixty-eight kids in the US, if early diagnosed it can help improve the child’s language and social ability significantly. In order to help Prof.Ahlquist’s daughter Ara, who is diagnosed with ASD, we are proposing the potential idea of adapting “Tap Tap Revenge” to the real world, in the form of a dancing game. We hope to significantly improve Ara’s ability to control her body movements and sharpen her kinesthetic senses through a fun game that can be played with friends or family. The proposed game environment will consist of a colored display with speakers at front, and two textile walls on the sides, forming a U-shaped room. The players will be prompted to tap at certain places on the sidewalls with correct strength and precision, determined by the rhythm of music played through the speakers. The algorithm will keep track of the timing and pressure of the taps, scoring how well the user ‘danced to the beat’, converting what is an exercise on body movements and control to an interactive game.
 
For this project, we will require the help of students from the art department for the physical structure and design aesthetics, while we (as software engineers) will be providing the algorithm and implementing the game itself. We believe that the project is both feasible and has room for expansion to ASD patients with other needs.
